# CRA Sample

This repository contains the `create-react-app` tool output when ran using this
command:

```sh
cd ..
npx create-react-app cra-sample
```

Every other file but this readme (which is in `.github/readme.md` to not clash
with the one generated by CRA) is generated using the above command. To create
this repository anew or update it, run the above command keeping in mind to
preserve this readme.

## Purpose

This repository exists separately like this so that I can use it as a submodule
in [`cra-ast-localize`](https://github.com/tomashubelbauer/cra-ast-localize).
