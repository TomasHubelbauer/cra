# CRA Sample

![](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/cra-sample/actions/workflows/cra.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains the `create-react-app` tool output when ran using this
command:

```sh
npx create-react-app cra
```

Every other file but this readme (which is in `.github/readme.md` to not clash
with the one generated by CRA) is generated using the above command.

[facebook/create-react-app/packages/cra-template]: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template/template

You can find the template at [facebook/create-react-app/packages/cra-template].
See [the documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates).
This repository is exactly that plus `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

## Purpose

This repository exists for two reasons,

[`cra-ast-localize`]: https://github.com/tomashubelbauer/cra-ast-localize

1. As a quick reference of the latest CRA generated source code
   This is useful because it is faster to look up than installing and running
   CRA using NPX and possibly googling for CRA default template.
2. To be used as a submodule in [`cra-ast-localize`]

## To-Do

### Generated both JavaScript and TypeScript templates in two different folders

Once this is done, also link to the TypeScript template in the readme:

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template-typescript

### Set up GitHub Pages running the build output of both the JS and TS versions

It will need a manual landing page with a switcher for what version to see, they
will appear the same, but still it will be two different sets of artifacts, so
it makes sense to add both. The index page will also need to be preserved by the
reset script in the workflow.

### Create an issue / otherwise cause an email on template change

The CRA tools templates are not changing very frequently so when they do, it
would be good to know as a prompt to check what has changed in the latest
release. Opening an issue and assigning it to myself could work to generate an
email, the issue could be titled something like "Check out new CRA version XYZ".
